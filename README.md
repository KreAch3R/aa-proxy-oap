# aa-proxy-oap
An "aa-proxy-rs", (a Rust implementation of AA Wireless Dongle) USB Gadget Integration for OpenAuto Pro

This is a WORK IN PROGRESS.

This took weeks and needed configurations across the whole Host/Headunit raspbian buster image, so I will try to document everything. I will come back and add/fix things for a while. Bear with me. 

Some terminology:
```
Host/Headunit:              RPI 4B running OpenAuto-Pro
Device/USB Gadget:          RPI 4B running an emulated OTG/USB Gadget device and using dummy_hcd to become a device to itself
aawg/aa-proxy-rs:           The program providing the wired to wireless AA proxy
```

# 1. High level explanation

### History

Starting on September 2023, with Android Auto update 12.7+, wireless AA stopped working on OpenAuto-Pro, and produced a black screen. At the same time, the same bug presented on Crankshaft, the opensource original source base that OpenAuto-Pro was based upon, but which never had working wireless AA.

OpenAuto-Pro went out of business, while OpenAuto-Pro and Crankshaft users started debugging for the problem. Many found out that using aftermarket AA wireless dongles, everything worked correctly.

The sent me into a research about opensource AA wireless dongles, and I came about the awesome project of https://github.com/nisargjhaveri/WirelessAndroidAutoDongle. After I tested it using a RPI-zero2w, I wanted to bypass the step of using two separate pi's inside my car and went looking for ways of emulating the second pi.

### Feasibility

I came around the awesome blog of Andrzej Pietrasiewicz:
https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/blog/2019/06/24/using-dummy-hcd/

There, he explains that using a kernel module named `dummy_hcd` we can emulate a USB UDC controller, that means, a controller that *accepts connections from itself as if a USB-GADGET DEVICE connected to it*.

So that left us with incorporating the configurations inside the `WirelessAndroidAutoDongle` image inside our own Raspbian Buster 32bit version of our RPI 4B pi, which proved to be a big task on its own.

That was because, the OpenAuto-Pro raspbian buster image is based on the 5.10.y rpi kernel (specifically, 5.10.103), while the `AAWirelessDongle` images are built using `buildroot` and are based on far newer kernels. 

That means that the `aawg` binary wasn't able to be installed as-is, because it required far newer "runtime libraries" like `libc`. As far as I searched, I couldn't find any way to build `aawg` statically.

Then another awesome project based on `WirelessAndroidAutoDongle` came to the rescue, https://github.com/manio/aa-proxy-rs. This one can be built completely statically!

### Proof of concept

So, to sum up, we need:

1. Re-build the kernel for our OpenAuto-Pro image, include all the necessary modifications for `usb-gadget` and `dummy_hcd` to work, and install it. 
2. Build `aa-proxy-rs` statically
3. Install the `Bluetooth`, `hostapd`, `dnsmasq` and whole other changes to our **Host** system.



# 2. Low level How-To

## Build and install the kernel

Instructions are to be included inside [kernel/README.md](https://github.com/KreAch3R/aa-proxy-oap/blob/main/kernel/README.md).

## Build and install `dummy_hcd`

Instructions are to be included inside [kernel/modules/raw-gadget/dummy_hcd/README.md](https://github.com/KreAch3R/aa-proxy-oap/blob/main/kernel/modules/raw-gadget/dummy_hcd/README.md).

## Modify `/etc/modules`

Add the necessary modules to start at boot.  
Equivalent to `sudo modprobe MODULE` after boot.  
This correlates with the running kernel configs. Configs marked as `=m` NEED to be included here. 

## Build and install `uMTP-Responder`

This is needed for the `usb-gadget` service to work.  
Instructions are to be included inside [uMTP-Responder/README.md](https://github.com/KreAch3R/aa-proxy-oap/blob/main/uMTP-Responder/README.md).

## Install all files inside `aa-proxy-oap`

The file structure of the `aa-proxy-oap` subfolder is following the structure of another project of mine, https://github.com/KreAch3R/navipi-usb-update.  
Basically, it's a copy-paste mechanism so the folders correspond to the **Host** system root folders and subfolders, generally. 

### Bluetooth

`aa-proxy-rs` is handling the Bluetooth connection, check its source code for how it's done. The `main.conf` file is needed.

### Wi-Fi Hotspot / hostapd / dhcpcd / dnsmasq

AA wireless requires a working Wi-Fi Hotspot setup by the **Host** system, and then `aa-proxy-rs` conveys the `ssid` and `password` to the phone through the established Bluetooth connection. 

`hostapd` and `dhcpcd` modifications are required for this. In constract to `WirelessAndroidAutoDongle` modifications, we need to use `dhcpcd`. 

Important: `OpenAuto-Pro` provides a `hotspot` toggle that modifies the same files. Make sure to enable it first, then edit the files. That makes sure that there aren't any conficts. 

### Systemd

In constract to `WirelessAndroidAutoDongle` modifications, we can't use `/etc/init.d`. At least, I didn't find out how. I translated the necessary startup scripts to `systemd` services, so that the `usb-gadget` can be setup after boot and `aa-proxy-rs` can be run, on our **Host** raspbian buster image. 


# 3. Result:

If everything runs correctly, after booting, the **Host** should launch OpenAuto-Pro as usual, then immediately connect to your phone, the phone should connect to the **Host**'s Wi-Fi hotspot, and then launch the AA Wireless sequence.
